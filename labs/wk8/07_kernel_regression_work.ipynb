        "-----------------------\n",
        "1. Basic idea of kernel methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "Kernel methods are a class of non-parametric machine learning algorithms that operate by mapping input data to a higher-dimensional space, often implicitly, using a kernel function. The kernel function measures the similarity between data points in this higher-dimensional space, allowing the algorithm to find non-linear relationships in the data more easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Non-parametric nature of kernel methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "A kernel method is considered non-parametric because it doesn't assume a specific functional form or a fixed number of parameters for the relationship between inputs and outputs. Instead, it directly relies on the training data and the chosen kernel function to define the model. This flexibility allows kernel methods to adapt to a wide range of data distributions and model complex relationships that might not be well-represented by a parametric model with a fixed functional form.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Parametric vs. kernel model prediction:\n",
        "\n",
        "In a parametric model like standard linear regression, the relationship between inputs (features) and outputs (labels) is defined by a fixed functional form with a finite number of parameters. For example, in linear regression, the relationship is given by y = wx + b, where w and b are the parameters (weights and bias) to be learned from the training data. To make a prediction for a new data point, the model applies the learned parameters to the input features using the assumed functional form.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, a kernel method uses the training data more directly. For a new data point, the kernel method computes the similarity between the new point and each of the training data points using the kernel function. The prediction is then made by combining the similarities with the training outputs (labels) in a weighted manner. This approach allows kernel methods to capture non-linear relationships without explicitly specifying a functional form.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Gram matrix and its entries:\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of kernel methods, the Gram matrix (denoted as 𝚿 or K) is a matrix that contains the pairwise similarities between all the data points in the dataset, as computed by the kernel function k. The entries of the Gram matrix are defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$K(i, j) = k(x_i, x_j)$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $x_i$ and $x_j$ are the i-th and j-th data points in the dataset ${x_i}_{n=1}^{N}$, and k is the kernel function. The Gram matrix plays a crucial role in kernel methods, as it encapsulates the similarity information used to make predictions for new data points."
